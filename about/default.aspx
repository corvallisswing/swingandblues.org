		<h1>About the weekend</h1>
	
		<p>Hi and welcome to <span class="eventName">Corvallis Swing and Blues Weekend</span>, three nights of dancing to live and DJ music in the heart of the Willamette Valley.</p>

		<p>Friday and Saturday nights will feature a combination of swing bands, blues bands, and DJ sets centered around each style of dance. The weekend culminates in a fusion dance Sunday evening, where DJs will mix both swing and blues, pushing the limits of what defines each style, and how much fun it is possible to have.</p>

			<p>The weekend will showcase our favorite venues and local musical talent, introducing you to the Corvallis dance community.</p>

			<p><span class="eventName">Corvallis Swing and Blues Weekend</span> is a collaborative adventure of the <a class="swing" href="http://corvallisswing.com">Corvallis Swing Dance Society</a> and <a class="blues" href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/osublues/">OSU Blues</a>. This event will mark the third aniversary of joint swing and blues dances hosted by the two groups and is a celebration of that partnership.</p>

			<p>The weekend is about great music and dancing, and it is also about collaboration and community. Our goal is to create an opportunity for the swing and blues groups of the Willamette Valley to gather as a larger community, and promote this incredible area to the rest of the country.</p>
