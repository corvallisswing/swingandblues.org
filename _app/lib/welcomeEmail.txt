Dear guest,

Welcome to {eventName}.

Our first dance begins at 9 p.m., with doors opening at 8:45. 

We'll be at the Women's Building on OSU campus, here: http://goo.gl/0Ge3w (160 SW 26th St). We suggest parking in the lots at Monroe Ave and 25th St, and walking down 26th until you reach the building on the right. If you get to Jefferson Ave, you've walked too far.

When you arrive, you'll receive a welcome packet with all the details for the weekend, including activities for Saturday afternoon.
