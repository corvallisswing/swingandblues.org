<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can usually hear Frim Fram holding down the monthly swing jam at
Squirrel's in downtown Corvallis, with Jacques Gabriel and Bill
Pfender on swing fiddle and clarinet, Paul Regan and Sam Holmes on
guitar, and Barb Barry-Doyle on standup bass.</p>

<p>Frim Fram is a year-and-a-half old, but the individual band members
have each been part of the Willamette Valley music scene for many
years, playing a range of music from jazz to swing to bluegrass to
folk in the bands Muddy River, Confluence, the Taylor Sisters, Tuxedo
Cafe, Melange and Prairiedog Backfire, to mention a few.</p>

<p>The band's players consider their musical influences to range from
Robert Johnson and Janis Joplin to the small combos of Benny Goodman,
Louis Armstrong, Stephane Grappelli, Bob Wills and Nat King Cole.</p>

<p>Worth describes his solo music as &ldquo;bohemian blues hop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Often
resorting to busking for artistic grounding, he claims to have
developed most of his vocal style and performance ability on the
street. &ldquo;There's nothing like playing on a street corner day in and
day out to get you into shape and ground you as an artist.&rdquo; 

<p>To the
listener his voice evokes an intense emotional response, even a full
body experience. It is simultaneously timeless and new, recalling
contemporary influences like Jeff Buckley, Martin Sexton, and Amos Lee
and classics such as Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder.</p>
			</div>
		</div> 
<p style="margin-top: 0.7em">The songwriting
is eclectic and infuses lyrical depth with memorable melodies. &ldquo;I like
to think of myself as equally a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter,
and performer and I try not to be limited by any definition of genre.
It's all music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the past year, Worth has collaborated with the likes of Russ
Liquid, Saqi, Unkle Nancy, and Marv Ellis on a variety of recordings
and live performances. He is currently based in Portland and splitting
his time between solo music, NIAYH, and a variety of other
collaborations. His debut release, &ldquo;Six Foot Soul,&rdquo; was released on
Sept. 14th 2012.</p>
