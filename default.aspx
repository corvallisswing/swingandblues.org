			<h4>Evening</h4>	
			<p>The weekend begins with an evening of live swing music from Gumbo in the OSU Women's Building, our weekly dance venue.</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gumbo synthesizes the roots of music heard in the American South in
the first half of the 20th century. Gumbo's original music draws from
the heart and soul of that musical time and place, reflecting the
excellent songwriting of that era in new ways.</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 2em">Gumbo is four guys who've been playing music since the mid 1960's in
rock, folk, country, swing, and jazz bands. Gumbo was started in 2005
by Sid Beam and Joe Casprowiak as a duo to play at Saturday markets
and coffee houses, joined soon after by bassist David Fournier.  Gumbo
performed the local pubs and eateries for a couple of years, then
added Dave Fienberg, a long time musical associate, on piano/keyboards
to begin focusing more on the original music being written by Sid
Beam, and to raise the energy level for performing larger venues, and
to begin recording the material with more diverse instrumentation. Now
they are just waiting for Dave Letterman to call and have them on his
show.</p>

		<p>Rae Gordon, Muddy award Nominee for Best Female Vocalist last year,
started singing as a teenager in the piano bars of Los Angeles. She
regularly attended the Tuesday open mic at the infamous comedy Store
on Sunset strip in "The Belly Room," where comedians and singers honed
their craft on the same stage. This led her to open for comedy acts
and head an open mic show at Carlos &amp; Charlie's. This rubbing of
elbows gave Rae the sense of humor that she brings to an audience
today.</p>

<p>After moving back to the northwest, she slipped into the blues scene
like and old shoe, garnering nominations and press for both blues and
gospel. In addition to performing at clubs and festivals throughout
the northwest, backed by a band of seasoned musicians, she has
performed with ensembles including the Northwest Women in Rhythm &amp;
Blues show, and as a guest performer at churches. She currently runs a
successful Thursday night blues jam and First Sunday Gospel Show at
the popular Trails end Saloon, a "Best Venue" award winner. Known far
and wide as a favorite of both local and national acts.</p>
